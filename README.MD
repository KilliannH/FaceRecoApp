**Facial recognition project in python**

* Step one : use openCV for facial recognition.

* Step two : take picture of people in good distance from camera to guess a face.

// Have a good algorithm to fire shot or not.

* Step three : train model with lot's of good images of my school staff

* Step four : Enjoy and train the model again.


NB : openCV is used to identify faces, not recognize them.

The recognize stuff / prediction is made with tensorflow



After some research : 
-> Google has already done it : Facenet
-> setup for tensorFlow : triplet loss function, convolultional neural network
-> pre-trained data : "Faces in the Wild data set"
-> crop and sized faces with Dlib
